**Project 1 — Market Basket Analysis \& Recommender for E-commerce**



**Market Basket Analysis in Data Mining**

**This project focused on developing a robust Market Basket Analysis model to predict customer purchase behavior and optimize product recommendations within a diversified e-commerce dataset. The primary objective was to uncover consumer purchasing patterns and leverage them to drive repeat sales and enhance recommendation systems.**

**The predictive modeling component utilized XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to classify whether a customer was likely to purchase again. Key behavioral and transactional features such as Return Rate, Popularity Index, and Engagement Score were engineered to strengthen the model’s predictive capacity. The classifier achieved an impressive 93% accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing customer intent.**

**To complement predictive modeling, association rule mining techniques were applied using Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat algorithms. These methods extracted frequent itemsets and generated actionable association rules, enabling the identification of product bundles and cross-selling opportunities. This dual approach—prediction plus association—provided both forward-looking insights and retrospective analysis of consumer behavior.**

**The project also emphasized data preprocessing, including handling missing values, label encoding, and feature engineering, ensuring the dataset was clean and optimized for analysis. An interactive interface was built using ipywidgets, allowing stakeholders to explore predictions and rules in real time. Additionally, visualizations created with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly enhanced interpretability, making complex patterns accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.**

**Overall, the project successfully combined machine learning and data mining techniques to deliver a comprehensive solution. It not only improved repeat purchase prediction but also enriched product recommendation strategies, offering valuable insights into consumer behavior that can directly inform e-commerce growth strategies.**
