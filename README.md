Pharmacy & Inventory Analytics – Assignment 3

Neuralbits Technologies Pvt. Ltd – Python Internship

This repository contains the complete solution for Assignment 3 based on pharmacy and inventory analytics. The goal of this project is to analyze medicine inventory, purchase batches, suppliers, sales data, expiry tracking, and overall pharmacy performance using SQL and Python.

The project includes all SQL queries required in the assignment, a Python script that can run these queries automatically, a Jupyter notebook for analysis, and a synthetic dataset to test the queries. The SQL file contains short explanations for each query, and the Python script helps automate the execution and save results as CSV files. The repository also contains short project write-ups and a summary of insights based on the dataset.

This project demonstrates skills in database querying, data analysis, Python scripting, and basic reporting. It also includes an optional Streamlit app that can display simple information like near-expiry medicines, top-selling items, and low stock alerts.

All files needed for the assignment are included in this repository so that the evaluation team can review the SQL logic, Python workflow, sample data, and analysis. This README provides a simple overview of what the project contains and what it is meant to do.

If needed, you may run the SQL queries or the Python script using your preferred tools, but all required components for the assignment have already been provided.
